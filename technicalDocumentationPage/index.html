            <p>Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser,
                and the network (when available). They are intended, among other things, to enable the creation of
                effective
                offline experiences, intercept network requests and take appropriate action based on whether the network
                is
                available, and update assets residing on the server. They will also allow access to push notifications
                and
                background sync APIs.

        <section id="Service_worker_concepts_and_usage" class="main-section">
            <header>
                Service worker concepts and usage
            </header>

            <p>
                A service worker is an event-driven worker registered against an origin and a path. It takes the form of
                a JavaScript file that can control the web-page/site that it is associated with, intercepting and
                modifying navigation and resource requests, and caching resources in a very granular fashion to give you
                complete control over how your app behaves in certain situations (the most obvious one being when the
                network is not available).
            </p>
            <p>
                A service worker is run in a worker context: it therefore has no DOM access, and runs on a different
                thread to the main JavaScript that powers your app, so it is not blocking. It is designed to be fully
                async; as a consequence, APIs such as synchronous XHR and localStorage can't be used inside a service
                worker.
            </p>
            <p>
                Service workers only run over HTTPS, for security reasons. Having modified network requests, wide open
                to man in the middle attacks would be really bad. In Firefox, Service Worker APIs are also hidden and
                cannot be used when the user is in private browsing mode.
            </p>
            <h4>Registration</h4>
            <pre id="codeBlock">
<code>
ServiceWorkerContainer.register(scriptURL, options)
.then(function(ServiceWorkerRegistration) { ... });
</code></pre>
            <li>scope.</li>
            <li>scriptURL.</li>

            <p>A service worker is first registered using the ServiceWorkerContainer.register() method. If successful,
                your service worker will be downloaded to the client and attempt installation/activation (see below) for
                URLs accessed by the user inside the whole origin, or inside a subset specified by you.</p>
        </section>













        <!-- cache -->
        <section id="Cache" class="main-section">
            <header>
                Cache
            </header>

            <p>The Cache interface provides a storage mechanism for Request / Response object pairs that are cached, for
                example as part of the ServiceWorker life cycle. Note that the Cache interface is exposed to windowed
                scopes as well as workers. You don't have to use it in conjunction with service workers, even though it
                is defined in the service worker spec.
            </p>

            <h4>Methods</h4>
            <li>
                Cache.match(request, options)
                <p>
                    Returns a Promise that resolves to the response associated with the first matching request in the
                    Cache
                    object.
                </p>
                <pre id="codeBlock">
<code>
cache.match(request, {options}).then(function(response) {
// Do something with the response
});

</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                Cache.add(request)
                <p>
                    Takes a URL, retrieves it and adds the resulting response object to the given cache. This is
                    functionally equivalent to calling fetch(), then using put() to add the results to the cache.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The add() method of the Cache interface takes a URL, retrieves it, and adds the resulting response
                    object to the given cache. The add() method is functionally equivalent to the following:


                </p>
                <pre id="codeBlock">
<code>
fetch(url).then(function(response) {
if (!response.ok) {
throw new TypeError('bad response status');
}
return cache.put(url, response);
})

</code></pre>

                <div id="warningNote">
                    <h3 id="warningTitle"> Note: </h3>
                    <p>
                        <code>add()</code> will overwrite any key/value pair previously stored in the cache that matches
                        the request.
                    </p>

                ServiceWorker

            </header>

            <p>The ServiceWorker interface of the ServiceWorker API provides a reference to a service worker. Multiple
                browsing contexts (e.g. pages, workers, etc.) can be associated with the same service worker, each
                through a unique ServiceWorker object.
            </p>
            <p>
                A ServiceWorker object is available in the ServiceWorkerRegistration.active property, and the
                ServiceWorkerContainer.controller property â€” this is a service worker that activated and controlling the
                page (the service worker has been successfully registered, and the controlled page has been reloaded.)
            </p>

            <h4>Properties</h4>
            <li>
                ServiceWorker.scriptURL

                <p>
                    Returns the ServiceWorker serialized script URL defined as part of ServiceWorkerRegistration. Must
                    be on the same origin as the document that registers the ServiceWorker.
                </p>
                <pre id="codeBlock">
<code>
someURL = ServiceWorker.scriptURL 

</code></pre>
                <p>A USVString (see the WebIDL definition of USVString.)</p>
            </li>
            <!-- new method/property -->
            <li>
                ServiceWorker.state

                <p>
                    The state read-only property of the ServiceWorker interface returns a string representing the
                    current state of the service worker. It can be one of the following values: installing, installed,
                    activating, activated, or redundant.

                </p>
                <p>
                    This code snippet is from the service worker registration-events sample (live demo). The code
                    listens for any change in the ServiceWorker.state and returns its value.


                </p>
                <pre id="codeBlock">
<code>
var serviceWorker;
if (registration.installing) {
serviceWorker = registration.installing;
document.querySelector("#kind").textContent = "installing";
} else if (registration.waiting) {
serviceWorker = registration.waiting;
document.querySelector("#kind").textContent = "waiting";
} else if (registration.active) {
serviceWorker = registration.active;
document.querySelector("#kind").textContent = "active";
}

if (serviceWorker) {
logState(serviceWorker.state);
serviceWorker.addEventListener("statechange", function(e) {
logState(e.target.state);
});
}

        <section id="FetchEvent" class="main-section">
            <header>
                FetchEvent

            </header>

            <p>
                This is the event type for fetch events dispatched on the service worker global scope. It contains
                information about the fetch, including the request and how the receiver will treat the response. It
                provides the event.respondWith() method, which allows us to provide a response to this fetch.
            </p>


            <h4>Properties</h4>
            <li>
                FetchEvent.request


                <p>
                    The request read-only property of the FetchEvent interface returns the Request that triggered the
                    event handler.

                    This property is non-nullable (since version 46, in the case of Firefox.) If a request is not
                    provided by some other means, the constructor init object must contain a request (see
                    FetchEvent.FetchEvent().)
                </p>
                <pre id="codeBlock">

var recentRequest = FetchEvent.request;

</code></pre>

            <li>
                FetchEvent.clientId

                <p>
                    The clientId read-only property of the FetchEvent returns the id of the Client that the current
                    service worker is controlling.



                </p>
                <p>
                    The Clients.get() method could then be passed this ID to retrieve the associated client.

            <header>
                InstallEvent
            </header>

            <p>The parameter passed into the oninstall handler, the InstallEvent interface represents an install action
                that is dispatched on the ServiceWorkerGlobalScope of a ServiceWorker. As a child of ExtendableEvent, it
                ensures that functional events such as FetchEvent are not dispatched during installation.</p>

            <h4>Properties</h4>
            <li>
                InstallEvent.activeWorker

                <p>
                    The activeWorker read-only property of the InstallEvent interface returns the ServiceWorker that is
                    currently actively controlling the page.

                    This will return null if no active worker is already controlling the page.
                </p>
                <pre id="codeBlock">
<code>
self.addEventListener('install', function(event) {
var myActiveWorker = event.activeWorker;
